This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles array keys and type juggling.  The issue arises when you try to use a non-string value as a key in an associative array.  While PHP might *seem* to accept it, it will silently convert the key to a string, leading to unexpected behavior. 
```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray[123] = 'value1';
$myArray[123.0] = 'value2';
$myArray['123'] = 'value3';
print_r($myArray);
?>
```
This will output:
```
Array
(
    [123] => value3
)
```
Notice that `value1` and `value2` are overwritten by `value3` because PHP converts both integer (123) and float (123.0) keys to the string '123'.
